<h1>About Cepi</h1>

<p>
	The MMORPG takes place in a vast fantasy world filled with magic and never before seen wonders.
	Where you can venture with friends and face challenges, discover unique regions, and become a part of the immersive world.

	Cepi's Development is different than many other projects similar to ours because we do not use bukkit or any forks,
	and we have plans to become open source.
	Our Development Team contains many talented individuals who have learned a lot and continue to grow while working on this project.
	We continue to strive to improve and are focused on delivering the best results possible.
