The MMORPG takes place in a vast fantasy world filled with magic and never before seen wonders.

Where you can venture with friends and face challenges, discover unique regions, and become a part of the immersive world.

Cepi's development is meant to be:

* Open Source      (anyone and everyone can contribute with the right skills)
* MMO-Oriented     (no more solo experiences -- play with your friends and experience gaming the right way)
* 0 margin for lag (lag should be a thing of the past.)
