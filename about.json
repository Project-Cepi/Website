# About Cepi

The MMORPG takes place in a vast fantasy world filled with magic and never before seen wonders.

Where you can venture with friends and face challenges, discover unique regions, and become a part of the immersive world.

Cepi's development is meant to be:

* Open Source      (anyone and everyone can contribute with the right skills)
* Modifiable       (make your own bosses, mobs, and experiences yourself!)
* Exploratory      (find new places and delve into new content to satisfy any power trip!)
